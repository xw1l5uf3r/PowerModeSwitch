This project is needed to switch the computer's power consumption modes.
Why do you need it? For example, if you just want to sit in the browser, you can turn on the power saving mode by pressing a key or a combination of keys, and if you want to play, you can switch to the high performance mode. The tray icon will change depending on the current power consumption mode.
This can save you energy.
